# Summary

Split the `Copy` trait in two traits: `Pod` and `Copy`. `Pod` indicates that a
type can be cloned by just copying its bits ("`memcpy`"), and the new `Copy`
indicates that the type should be implicitly copied instead of moved.

# Motivation

### `Range` is not `Copy` (or deriving `Copy` is hard)

We have a guideline that says that iterators should not be implicitly copyable
(i.e. they shouldn't implement `Copy`). The `Range` struct, which is what
`a..b` desugars to, is an iterator, and under this guideline it shouldn't be
`Copy`, but this hurts ergonomics in other cases where it's not used as an
iterator, for example a struct that contains `Range` can't be marked as `Copy`,
because `Range` is not `Copy`.

This is a more general problem, if upstream decides that some type shouldn't be
`Copy`, even if it could, then downstream can't make `Copy`able structs/enums
that contain said type.

### `Cell` only admits `Copy` data

This is unnecessarily restrictive because the data doesn't need to be
implicitly copyable, the actual requirement is that the data should be
cloneable by just `memcpy`ing it.

### How splitting `Copy` helps with this?

Implementing `Pod` for a type is much less controversial than implementing
`Copy` on it. This should result in more types marked as `Pod` in libraries,
which in turn gives downstream users more control about what can be `Copy` as
the only requirement is that the fields must be `Pod`.

`Cell` can be modified to have a `Pod` bound instead of a `Copy` one, this
would allow more types, like iterators, to be stored in a `Cell`.

# Detailed design

### The traits

A `Pod` marker trait will be added to the stdlib, and the `Copy` trait will be
updated as follows:

```
/// Indicates that this type can be cloned by just copying its bits (`memcpy`)
#[lang = "pod"]
trait Pod: MarkerTrait {}

/// Indicates that this type will be implicitly copied instead of moved
#[lang = "copy"]
trait Copy: Pod {}
```

### Compiler rules

Update the compiler to enforce the following rules:

- `Pod` can only be implemented by structs/enums whose fields are also `Pod`.
- Built-in/primitive types that were automatically considered `Copy` by the
  compiler (`i8`, `&T`, `(A, B)`, `[T; N]`, etc), will now be considered to be
  both `Pod` and `Copy`.

### `#[derive]` syntax extensions

To avoid breaking the world, the `#[derive(Copy)]` syntax extension will be
updated to derive *both* `Copy` and `Pod`:

``` rust
#[derive(Copy)]
struct Foo<T>(T);

// expands into
impl<T: Pod> Pod for Foo<T> {}
impl<T: Pod> Copy for Foo<T> {}
//^ note that the bound is `T: Pod` (not `T: Copy`!)
```

Also add a `#[derive(Pod)]` extension to derive only `Pod`.

### `Cell`

`Cell` will be change its `T: Copy` bound to `T: Pod`.

# Drawbacks

Cognitive load. Currently you have to think whether a type should be `Clone`,
`Copy+Clone` or neither (affine type). Now you have to choose between `Clone`,
`Pod+Clone`, `Pod+Clone+Copy` or neither. (There are other combinations like
e.g `Pod+Copy`, but you almost always want to add `Clone` in there as well)

# Alternatives

Don't do this, figure out how some other way to solve the `Range` problem
(should it be `Copy`?). And, don't let non-implictly copyable structs (like
most iterators) be stored in `Cell`s.

### More magic `#[derive]`s

To reduce the burden of having to write `#[derive(Pod, Clone)]` and
`#[derive(Copy, Clone)]`, the `#[derive]` syntax extensions could be modified
as follows:

- `#[derive(Clone)]` derives `Clone`
- `#[derive(Pod)]` derives `Pod` and `Clone`
- `#[derive(Copy)]` derives `Pod`, `Clone` and `Copy`

This means that for any type you only have to pick *one* of these `#[derive]`s
or neither.

The author would prefer to obtain the same behavior not with syntax extensions
but with a blanket implementation:

``` rust
impl Clone for T where T: Pod {
    fn clone(&self) -> T {
        unsafe {
            mem::transmute_copy(self)
        }
    }
}
```

However, this is not actionable without negative bounds because of coherence
issues (overlapping implementations).

# Unresolved questions

- Is there a name that better describes what `Pod` is?
- Should we bring back the "you could implement `Pod` for type" lint? The
  author thinks that you almost always want to mark as many things as possible
  as `Pod` - that's not the case with the current `Copy` (e.g. iterators).
- Should the `Pod` trait be in the prelude?
